Email verification is required within 24 hours of registration. Users can choose between buyer accounts (free) or seller accounts (which require additional business verification). The buyer registration is straightforward: username, email, password, and optional phone number for SMS notifications. Password rules enforce a minimum of 8 characters including one uppercase letter and one number. For account recovery, Shoplite supports email-based reset links and optional two-factor authentication (2FA) via TOTP apps (e.g., Google Authenticator). Seller registration begins with company name, tax ID, business address, bank account information for payouts, and uploading identification documents. Shoplite performs automated checks and then a manual review. Once approved, sellers receive an onboarding email with links to seller dashboard, inventory upload templates (CSV), and API keys for integration. Users may upgrade or downgrade account types in Account Settings; downgrades may affect seller features and payout schedules. All accounts must agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy during sign-up. The document includes examples of common registration errors (invalid email formats, password mismatch, duplicate email) and recommended UI messages to reduce user friction. Finally, we describe how Shoplite notifies users about unverified accounts and the process to resend verification links.\",\n",

Filters include category, price range, seller rating, shipping time, availability (in-stock), condition (new/refurbished), and promotions. The UI supports multi-select filters and dynamic counts. Search relevancy uses a weighted mix of title matches, description matches, popularity, conversion rate, and seller reputation. For personalized search, Shoplite applies user history (recently viewed, purchased categories) to boost results. Sorting options include 'Relevance', 'Price: Low to High', 'Price: High to Low', 'Best Sellers', and 'Newest'. Autocomplete leverages prefix matching and trending queries; it returns up to 6 suggestions and throttles suggestions per session to reduce API load. For API consumers, search endpoints accept `q`, `filters` (JSON), `sort`, `page`, and `per_page`. Query performance is optimized with a cached product index updated incrementally as inventory changes. The document also details how to handle out-of-stock SKUs (show 'notify me' and hide from default listings when hidden by seller) and how promotional badges (e.g., 'Free shipping', 'Top Seller') are calculated and presented.\",\n",

A cart may contain items from multiple sellers; Shoplite splits the checkout into a unified payment while creating distinct seller-level orders for fulfillment. During checkout, taxes and shipping are estimated based on shipping address and seller settings; final amounts are calculated at order placement. The checkout flow includes address selection, shipping option selection (standard, expedited), payment method, promo code entry, and order review. Payment authorization occurs immediately; capture occurs at the time of order placement except where preauthorization rules apply (e.g., high-risk orders). The system supports saved cards (tokenized) and wallets. For multi-seller orders, Shoplite aggregates totals but tracks each seller’s payout and commission separately. The platform supports invoice generation and sends order confirmation emails to buyer and seller with expected shipping windows. Failed payments trigger retries and email notifications; if payment fails after retries, the order is canceled and inventory restored. The cart UI provides clear error messages when items become unavailable during checkout and supports one-click purchase for stored payment methods.\",\n",

Additional fraud mitigation includes AVS check, CVV verification, velocity checks, device fingerprinting, and machine-learning risk signals that trigger manual review for suspect transactions. Refunds are processed through the original payment method and may take 3–10 business days depending on bank processing times. For high-value or flagged transactions, Shoplite may require manual KYC review or additional documents. The Security section covers encryption (TLS 1.2+), secrets management, and recommended developer practices: use short-lived keys, rotate API keys, restrict webhook IPs, and validate payload signatures.

Delivery estimates are calculated using seller location, buyer location, service level, and lead time. The platform supports fulfillment options: seller fulfillment, platform-fulfilled (Shoplite Logistics), or third-party logistics (3PL) integrations. For multi-seller orders, each item gets its own shipment tracking; the buyer sees them consolidated in the order view. Delivery exceptions (missed delivery, address problem) initiate a notification sequence and request seller or buyer action. For international orders, customs, duties, and VAT handling rules are documented; Shoplite can present DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) or DAP options depending on seller preference.

Once a return is approved, the buyer receives a return authorization and instructions for shipping (prepaid label or buyer-paid depending on seller policy). Refunds are issued after the seller confirms item receipt and inspection; in case of seller dispute, Shoplite’s dispute resolution team intervenes. For seller-initiated refunds (e.g., wrong item), refunds are processed immediately and inventory is adjusted. Partial refunds for damaged items are supported. The document describes the timeline for refunds (typically 3–10 business days), restocking fees (optional for sellers), and cases where the buyer may receive replacement or store credit.

To prevent abuse, Shoplite enforces policies: one review per purchase, detection of suspicious review patterns, and manual moderation for flagged content. Sellers may respond to reviews publicly. Reviews feed into search ranking, with higher-rated products boosted in relevance for certain filters. The platform supports Q&A where prospective buyers ask the seller public questions; sellers and other buyers may answer. Reviews API allows export for sellers to display on external sites.
