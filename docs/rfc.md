## AI Touchpoints

As part of ShopLiteâ€™s AI-first exploration, we identified candidate use cases and selected **two near-term touchpoints** that deliver measurable value:

- **Typeahead Search Suggestions**: improves product discovery and boosts conversion.  
- **Support Assistant (FAQ + Order Status)**: reduces support contact volume and improves first-response times.  

Both are feasible with existing data sources (catalog DB, FAQ markdown, `order-status` API) and meet latency/cost constraints.  

For full detail on candidate capabilities, latency budgets, and cost analysis, see the [AI Capability Map](/docs/ai-first/ai-capability-map.md).
